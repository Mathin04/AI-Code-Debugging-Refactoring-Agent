 Project Overview:
Welcome to my "Capstone Project" from the 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course by Google!  
This agent "analyzes your code",
"detects errors", 
"suggests fixes", 
and "refactors it" for better readability and performance. It’s like having an AI coding assistant right on your machine!  

Why it matters: Saves time, reduces errors, and improves code quality—all automatically.  

 Key Features:
-  Agent Development Kit (ADK):** Core AI intelligence for task automation.  
-  Task Automation:** Detects & fixes common coding errors automatically.  
-  Code Refactoring:** Improves readability, structure, and efficiency.  
-  Workflow Optimization:** Automates repetitive coding tasks to boost productivity.  

 Installation:
git clone https://github.com/Mathin04/AI-Code-Debugging-Refactoring-Agent.git
cd AI-Code-Debugging-Refactoring-Agent
python -m venv venv           
source venv/bin/activate      
pip install -r requirements.txt

Course Context:
